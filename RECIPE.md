Recipe:

1. Preheat the oven to 165^C and grease and line a    15cm by 15cm square brownie tin or baking tin.

2. Break up the chocolate into small pieces in a heatproof bowl and melt it down over a pan of gentle simmering the water. Remove from the heat and leave to cool until needed.

3. Whisk the butter and sugar together until they are light and fluffy and mix well.

4. Fold in the melted chocolate mixture and then sift in the flour and cocoa

5. When the mixture is well combined, transfer to the prepared tin and cook for 25 to 30 minutes until cooked- the brownies should still be soft in the middle.

6. Transfer to a wire rack and then cut into pieces.
